# YouTube Studio & Posts Mobile Enhancement

This is a user script designed to dramatically improve the mobile experience of the YouTube Studio and the post creation/community tab interfaces on both desktop and mobile YouTube sites. It uses CSS to create a responsive, compact layout and JavaScript to add missing functionality.

## Features

-   **Fully Responsive UI**: Makes the YouTube Studio and post creation dialogs usable on mobile devices.
-   **Compact Layout**: Reduces padding, margins, and font sizes for a more screen-efficient interface.
-   **Functional "Create Post" Button**: Adds a working "Create" button to the mobile YouTube header, allowing you to easily access the community post creation page.
-   **Scrollable Tabs**: Fixes tab navigation in Studio on mobile by making them horizontally scrollable.
-   **Improved Dialogs**: Ensures all pop-ups and dialogs are properly sized and scrollable on small screens.
-   **Accessibility Enhancements**: Improves focus indicators and ensures form inputs are user-selectable.
